# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

The simulation and calculations are done in your web browser, so the answers to the
questions stay with you, we do not collect any of them.

However, we do track some information about your use of this
simulator, such as the pages consulted and the time spent, with the sole
for the sole purpose of improving it.

In particular, we track the address of the end page of the simulation,
which contains the total of your footprint and its distribution in large
categories (transportation, housing, ...).

You can find out more and disable this tracking below.

The group simulation modes, conference and survey, use our servers to aggregate multiple simulations and communicate them between participants.

## Personal data processing

The present Nos Gestes Climat platform is an initiative of the French Agency for Ecological Transition, ADEME, which is responsible for processing the personal data collected by the platform.

## Personal data processed

### a) Data related to the simulation

The data that is entered during the simulation is stored locally in the platform user's browser. It is deleted when the user clears the data from the browser, or clicks on the "Start over" button on the [profile page](/profile).

In the group simulation, each participant is assigned a random pseudonym (conference mode) or a random ID (survey mode) in order to remain anonymous.

In this sense, and according to the guidelines of the CNIL, the processing is not considered as a processing of personal data.

### b) Data related to the results of the individual simulation

In particular, we track the address of the end of simulation page, the name of the conference page, which contains the total of your footprint and its breakdown into major categories (transportation, housing, ...), via the open tool for analyzing the audience of Matomo websites, hosted by data.gouv.fr.

### c) Data related to the results of the group simulation

In the group simulation, participants' results are aggregated with those of other conference participants: total and categories (transportation, housing, etc.). Also shared is the simulation progress from 0 to 1.

#### Conference mode

Conference mode is based on peer-to-peer technology: users connected to a given conference via its URL are connected via a [reporting server](https://github.com/yjs/y-webrtc). At this stage, no information specific to ourclimategests is shared.

During the simulation in conference mode, the results described in the introduction of paragraph c) are shared between each user, directly via their internet connection.

#### Survey mode

The survey mode is based on a server hosted by ADEME via our provider Scalingo, whose code is open and available [on github](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-server).

Before any data sharing with our server, the user is asked if he wants to participate in the survey mode.

During the simulation in survey mode, the results described in the introduction of paragraph c) are sent to the server, which in turn shares them with each user of the survey.

The user has the possibility to quit the survey via the "Quit survey" button. His or her data will then be kept in the survey results, but future entries on the site will no longer be sent to the server.

### d) Cookies

Cookies are used to track the use of the simulator, such as pages viewed and time spent, in order to improve the platform.

## Legal basis for data processing

The data processed during these treatments have several legal bases:
- The consent of the data subject for one or more specific purposes within the meaning of Article 6-a of the GDPR and pursuant to Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC as amended;
- The performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller within the meaning of Article 6-e of the GDPR;

These grounds are specified below:

### a) Data relating to the results of the simulation

This processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller within the meaning of Article 6-e of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
They enable anonymized statistics on the carbon footprint in France to be produced.

### b) Cookies

Pursuant to Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC, as amended, concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, transposed into Article 83 of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on information technology, files and freedoms, tracers or cookies are subject to two distinct regimes.

Audience measurement cookies, when the data is anonymized, do not require consent. In this case, the platform uses Matomo in its anonymized version, you can nevertheless oppose the tracking of your navigation on this website, via the insert at the beginning of the document.

## Data retention period

### Data related to the simulation

The data is kept locally on the browser until the action of the user to delete the data from the browser, from the nosgestesclimat.fr domain in particular, or via the [profile page](/profile).

### Data relative to the results of the simulation

The data are anonymized, once anonymized, the data are no longer considered as personal data, the regulation on the protection of personal data is no longer applicable. For more information see [the CNIL guide](https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/guide_durees_de_conservation.pdf).

### Cookies

### Web site hosting

The website is hosted by Netlify, as indicated in the legal notice on the [about] page.

The survey data storage server is hosted by [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com) SAS, 15 avenue du Rhin 67100 Strasbourg France.
