# Accessibility Statement

ADEME is committed to making its websites accessible in accordance with Article 47 of Law No. 2005-102 of 11 February 2005.
This declaration of accessibility applies to the Nos Gestes Climat website.

## State of compliance

The Nos Gestes Climat website (https://nosgestesclimat.fr/) is partially compliant with the General Accessibility Guidelines, RGAA version 4.1, due to the non-conformities listed in the section "Test results".

## Test results

The compliance audit conducted on 15/06/2022 by the company Access42 reveals that **the site is 50% compliant with the RGAA version 4.1**.

### Inaccessible content

The contents listed below are not accessible for the following reasons.

#### Non-conformities

-   Information-bearing images have no or no relevant alternative;
-   Decorative images are not ignored by assistive technologies;
-   Images have captions that are not properly linked;
-   Text and interface components have insufficient contrast
-   Links do not have an explicit heading;
-   JavaScript features are not compatible with assistive technologies (including carousel, show and hide content, autocomplete fields and modal windows);
-   Context changes are triggered without the user being aware of them;
-   Status messages are not returned by assistive technologies
-   Pages contain source code errors
-   Pages do not have a relevant page title;
-   Language changes in the text are not reported;
-   Pages use tags for presentation purposes (e.g. unstructured text in paragraph tags);
-   Pages have an irrelevant title hierarchy (missing or ill-defined titles)
-   The structure and main areas of the pages are poorly defined;
-   Sequences of elements are not structured with lists
-   Some texts with a defined font color do not have an associated background color;
-   Visual indications of focus are not sufficiently contrasted;
-   Form fields do not have a correctly linked label or no relevant label;
-   Groupings of similar fields do not have a title;
-   Form buttons have irrelevant labels;
-   Input helpers are not linked to their respective fields;
-   The site does not have a navigation system;
-   Quick access links are not visible on mobile;
-   Cryptic content has no alternative;
-   The orientation of the pages is restricted to portrait mode;
-   Features that can be used with a complex gesture do not have an alternative with a simple management.

#### Exceptions for disproportionate load

The documentation pages use the "Publicodes" library which is essential to the processing of published information and which has no equivalent adapted to our need. This library inserts by CSS information elements (brackets) in some calculation formulas which is not compliant with criterion 10.2 of RGAA 4.1. This library manages the title of some pages which may be irrelevant which is not compliant with criterion 8.6 of RGAA 4.1.

Modifying this library to change this behavior would require a significant amount of work for which we do not have the skills. Nevertheless, aware of the problem, we have opened an [issue](https://github.com/betagouv/publicodes/issues/226) to request the correction of this problem and we will update the library when its authors have passed on the correction. Due to the content of the problem, it is not possible to propose an alternative.

The Datagir team uses office documents produced by ADEME. These documents are derogated by ADEME, but it is possible to contact them to obtain accessible alternatives: https://agirpourlatransition.ademe.fr/particuliers/accessibilite.

The Datagir team uses office documents produced by the Association Bilan Carbone (ABC). These documents are waived by ADEME. There is no alternative.

The "actions" pages contain graphs and tables that do not have detailed descriptions. Adding these detailed descriptions is a disproportionate burden for Datagir. There is no alternative.
