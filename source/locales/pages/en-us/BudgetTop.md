# Budget

**Nos Gestes Climat** is a digital public service, which is why we are
transparent about the resources we allocate and how they are used
used.

## Principles

We follow the <a href="https://beta.gouv.fr/approche/manifeste">beta.gouv manifesto</a>
manifesto, the principles of which can be found here:

> - The needs of users take precedence over the needs of the administration
> - The team's management style is based on trust
> - The team adopts an iterative, continuous improvement approach

## How it works

Nos Gestes Climat is a state-owned start-up: the team is therefore led by an intrapreneur who is responsible for the digital service developed within his administration (ADEME in this case).

His role is multifaceted: deployment, product management, reporting to his administration (budget, progress reports).

The budget shown here does not include the intrapreneur, since he is an ADEME employee, but concerns the team members.
