# About us

## What is it?

This simulator allows you to evaluate your total annual individual
carbon footprint and by major categories (food, transportation, housing,
miscellaneous, public services, digital), to situate it in relation to
the climate objectives and, above all, to take action at your level with
personalized actions according to your answers.

Based on an [analysis of existing calculators at the beginning of
2020](https://abc-transitionbascarbone.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/analyse-des-calculateurs-dempreinte-carbone-individuelle-a-lorigine-de-nos-gestes-climat-vf-.pdf),
it is based on the MicMac model of the associations [Avenir
Climatique](https://avenirclimatique.org/les-outils/) and
[TaCa](https://www.taca.asso.fr/).

## Who is developing it?

This carbon calculator is developed by the [Datagir](https://datagir.ademe.fr/)
team of [The French Agency for Ecological Transition ](https://www.ademe.fr/)
(ADEME) and [beta.gouv.fr](https://beta.gouv.fr/), in partnership with
the [Association Bilan Carbone](https://www.associationbilancarbone.fr/) (ABC).
